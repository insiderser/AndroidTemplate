This is the project that contains all the common
logic that I use (or plan to use) to build Android apps.

This template includes:

  - multi-module setup with reusable logic in [buildSrc](buildSrc/)
  - CI configuration with GitHub Actions
  - repeated code that we do in most Android apps nowadays
  - basic Dagger setup
  
Inspired by:
  - [iosched](https://github.com/google/iosched/)
  - [tivi](https://github.com/chrisbanes/tivi)
  - Numerous articles & docs
